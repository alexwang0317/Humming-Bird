# Humming-Bird

This is a repository dedicated to code written for my drone project. There are many potential avenues to pursue for this drone project including computer vision (for object + facial recognition), NLP (commands), and a mechanism to triggering a nerf gun. 

Currently using:
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
- Pixhawk 6c 

Future plans:
- Nvidia Jetson Nano
