# Humming-Bird

This is a repository dedicated to code written for drone project. There are many potential avenues to pursue for this drone project including computer vision (for object + facial recognition), NLP (commands), and a mechanism to triggering a nerf gun. 

In order for this to operate, you will need an OpenAI API key which you create a .env file to store.
